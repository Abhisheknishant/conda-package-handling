Enhancements:
-------------

* add a "prefix" keyword argument to the api.extract function.  When combined with dest_dir, the prefix is the base directory, and the dest_dir is the folder name.  dest_dir alone as an abspath is both the base directory and the folder name.

Bug fixes:
----------

* provide a non-ProcessPoolExecutor path when number of processes is 1
* open files to be added to archives in binary mode.  On Windows, the implicit default was text mode, which was corrupting newline data and putting in null characters.
* extraction prefix defaults to the folder containing the specified archive.  This is a behavior change from 1.3.x, which extracted into the CWD by default.
